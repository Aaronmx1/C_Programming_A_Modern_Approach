# C_Programming_A_Modern_Approach
C Programming - A Modern Approach 2nd Edition by K.N. King

I am new to C programming and learning from the book mentioned above.
Found some contributor code for this book on here that has been very helpful and I would like to add my files as I may reach a solution different than others.
I hope this helps someone like me who would like to understand the C language better or just curious minds.
Enjoy!
